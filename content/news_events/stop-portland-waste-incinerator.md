The [Portland Incinerator campaign](https://stopportlandwasteincinerator.co.uk/) needs your help and has supplied this announcement:  
​  
There will be a significant negative impact across Dorset needlessly adding to the greenhouse gases and encouraging an unabated buy, throw, no change attitude. Not only will there be a plume from the now increased chimney high of 90m – located below where many people live and work - but it will be lit day and night with a high intensity aviation warning light visible all along the coast. Portland has a very frequent standing lee wave cloud sitting on the top and this bounces and traps light and pollution.

**This will be a symbol** for the life time of the plant that we are unable to respond to the Climate Emergency and we are not able to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. SPWI and all our many many supporters consider this to be totally unacceptable. UNESCO status is to educate the world – Jurassic knowledge is about extinction – the Climate Emergency is an existential threat. This proposal has significant greenhouse gas emissions and perpetuates the habits of the past of buy and throw and ignores the dire consequence.  
How can you help? Please tell everyone about this issue. We need to get technical and legal to fight with teeth. Pollution for Profit on Portland should not be allowed [https://justgiving.com/crowdfunding/stopportlandwasteincinerator](https://justgiving.com/crowdfunding/stopportlandwasteincinerator "https://justgiving.com/crowdfunding/stopportlandwasteincinerator")
