We now have 64 organisations including 23 Town and Parish Councils representing over 109,000 residents of Dorset working within our Alliance to improve the _Dorset Local Plan_.

### Dorset Deserves Better

**Dorset Deserves Better (DDB)** is an alliance to suggests ways to transform the the widely criticised _Dorset Local Plan_ (of March 2021) into a visionary programme that enriches the county and serves the people of Dorset – especially the young and those most in need.

### Dorset Local Plan Problems

The plan proposes almost 40,000 new houses with associated roads, car parks & services. **These will encroach on our precious Green Belt, our famous Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty**, and other locally valued greenfield land.

Our Campaign Alliance has now written to Dorset Council arguing that the Local Plan in its current form would:
​
1. Do great harm to Dorset, through adverse impact on its natural environment, landscape and historical character
2. Fall short of meeting the needs of Dorset’s population for the right houses in the right place at the right price
3. Fail to face up to the global challenges of climate change and loss of wildlife, which are spelt out in the Climate & Ecological Emergency Strategy adopted by Dorset Council

### DDB Response

Co-ordinated by DorsetCAN founder member Professor Michael Dower, CBE, we wrote an open letter - summarized here:

"_...we are baffled to find that the Council has chosen to base the Plan on a scale of growth in housing, workspace and supporting infrastructure which cannot be achieved without grave damage to [the county's] rich heritage. The Council has ignored the opportunity, offered by government, to use Dorset’s exceptional heritage as the reason for taking an alternative approach to calculating the scale of development that is needed and that is within the capacity of the County to absorb._

_The adverse impact of the Plan’s proposals on landscape, biodiversity & climate change is shown to startling degree in the Sustainability Assessments. The Council could not keep its pledge to “ensure that all new development incorporates ecological net gain”._

_We therefore urge the Council to think again, to choose a level of growth based simply on local needs, and thereby to draw back from grave incursions on the AONB, encroachment on the Green Belt and the placing of heavy pressure on regions already under severe strain._"
