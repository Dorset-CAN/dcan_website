**The Great Big Dorset Hedge (GBDH)** is a campaign to plant, expand, extend, join-up and map sections of hedgerow around and across Dorset into multiple corridors that promote biodiversity and help wildlife of all sorts (birds, insects, amphibians, mammals, wildflowers, trees, fungi) to flourish across the county.

### Actions

We are starting with the Jubilee Trail, the Stour Valley Way, the Brit Valley Trail, the Wareham Forest Way and the Purbeck Wayt, but the more wandering and diverse the hedge becomes, the more it will start to form a giant network of natural connections and wildlife-friendly corridors.

It might take a generation for it to stretch the length and breadth of the county.

### Imagine

Imagine a Great Big Dorset Hedge, made up of a network of connected, well-managed hedgerows, stretching across Dorset, north to south and east to west, so that every community has an opportunity to get involved.

We want to catch the imagination of people across Dorset, so the campaign takes shape and grows alongside the hedgerow.

Imagine gaps or lost connections in a Great Big Dorset Hedge being planted up, in many cases by local tree planting groups with the young and old working side by side, connected by a common desire to see more hedges and trees in Dorset.

Imagine the Great Big Dorset Hedge helping people to feel more connected with the places where they live and work, with nature, and with their communities through a shared scheme that actively helps nature recovery in Dorset.

Imagine helping communities to plant and look after more hedgerow trees, encouraging them to talk about them, to celebrate their companionship and the many benefits they bring us and the natural world.

### Our plan

* ● Help to strengthen the existing network of hedgerows in Dorset including in towns and villages as gardens are vital refuge areas for wildlife and a source of biodiversity.
* ● Identify where new areas of hedging can be planted.  We already have several new hedging projects under way.
* ● Identify where existing hedging needs improving and best methods to achieve this.
* ● Create an understanding of what a healthy hedge looks like, the value of hedgerows as a key wildlife habitat, their importance in providing protection against climate change and their role as a valuable"
