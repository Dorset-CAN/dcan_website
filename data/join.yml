      Dorset CAN was formed in October 2021 as a network of community groups and
      individuals working together for a shared vision of a clean, green,
      sustainable, zero carbon Dorset.
    </b>
    <br><br>
    We run campaigns, work with local councils, organise events and work with schools,
    families, individuals and organisations across Dorset. We act as a hub gathering
    and sharing news, updates, ideas and case studies from communities across Dorset,
    nationally and overseas.
    <br><br>
    We have teams working on Energy, Transport, Land Use and Agriculture, Media
    and Communications, Campaigns and more. Already we have:
    <br>
    * submitted detailed and wide-ranging proposals to Dorset Council on its
      Climate and Ecological Emergency Strategy and its Dorset Local Plan (see
      them here).
      <br>
    * held Dorset Council to account with questions at their regular Council meetings.
    <br>
    * run online events on topics like energy-saving homes, tree/hedge planting
      and climate action.
    <br>
    * Now we’re planning co-ordinated action to reduce the housing allocation
      in the Local Plan; to run two Greener open homes weekends; to move forward
      on our tree/hedgerow projects, and to keep up the pressure on Dorset Council
      over the Climate & Ecological Emergency.
    <br><br>

      Two ways you can do your bit to help Dorset respond to the climate and nature crisis…
    </b>
    <br>
    * To have a persuasive voice with Dorset Council and others, we need as many
    members as possible. Please sign up as an individual member here and ask
    your friends to join too. If you represent an organisation, please sign up
    as an organisational member
    <a href="https://mailchi.mp/099e27e01c57/organisation">here</a>.
    <br>
    * Membership is free and we are all volunteers, but we do have publicity,
    website and other costs. If you’re able to, please make a donation
    <a href="https://gmail.us6.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=b44a7957792302591902366d7&id=bf4a8bd033">here</a>.
    <br><br>

    But most important, please join DorsetCAN  as an individual member or an organisational member today.
    <br>
    Together, Dorset (really) CAN!
